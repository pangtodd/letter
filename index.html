      <p>Dear <span class="firstName"></span>  <span class="lastName"></span>,</p>

      <p>I was recently reviewing my files, and I was reminded about that sweet <span class="carType"></span> you use to get around. It would be a shame if anything were to happen to it. I did some digging around, and it turns out your extended warranty has expired! I thought I would take this opportunity to help you out. Using my connections in the insurance industry, I have pulled some strings, I can extend your warranty, but you must act fast! Please contact me as soon as you are able.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I was reminded about that lovely <span class="domicle"></span> you live in. What a sweet pad! If you're ever intersted in selling it, contact me for a quick, fair, cash offer. No repairs needed!</p>
      <p>Finally, if you have any interest in exploring the world of NFTs, I have some great opportunties for you. Bottom line- give me a call. I promise it will be worth your time.<br><br><br>Your pal,<br><br><br>Nathan Detroit</p>
